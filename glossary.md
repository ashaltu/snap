# Glossary

## A

### Abstraction
Removing the specifics that are not relevant in a given context.

**Lessons:** [Customization](customization/README.md)

### Argument 
Any area in a block that accepts user input, or another block. It could be a Boolean Block or a value placed inside of a variable or block. The value that is "passed into" a parameter of a custom block.

**Lessons:** [Customization](customization/README.md)

## B

### Backgrounds
Pictures that fill the entire stage area. 

### Block
Puzzle-piece shapes that are used to create code in snap!

**References:** [Blocks](references/blocks/README.md) | **Lessons:** [Getting Started with Snap!](getting_started_with_snap/README.md)

### Boolean Expression
A value (text, number, picture, etc.) that evaluate to true or false.

**Lessons:** [Loops](loops/README.md)

### Boolean Operators
Boolean expressions that can be nested.

**Lessons:** [Loops](loops/README.md)


## C

### Command Block
Puzzle-piece shaped block that executes a command (it causes an effect).

**Lessons:** [Customization](customization/README.md)

### Cloning
A feature that allows a sprite to create a clone, or semi-duplicate, of itself, while the project is running. Clones of a sprite will be the same as the original or parent sprite but as a separate instance. Clones inherit the parent's scripts, costumes, sounds, and properties, yet they can then be modified.

**Lessons:** [Cloning](cloning/README.md)

### Conditional 
A block used to make a choice between executing two different chunks of code."If" statements.

**Lessons:** [Loops](loops/README.md)

### Contains Block
Checks an operator block for a particular variable.

**Lessons:** [Lists](lists/README.md)

### Costume
A costume is one out of possibly many "frames" or alternate appearances of a sprite.

**Lessons:** [Getting Started with Snap!](getting_started_with_snap/README.md)

**Lessons:** [Loops](loops/README.md)

## G

### Generalization
Combining a group of related concepts or processes into a single category.

**Lessons:** [Customization](customization/README.md)

**Lessons:** [Lists](lists/README.md)

### Jukebox
A collection of sounds that can be applied to a sprite costume. 

## K

`No K entries`

## L

### Lists Block
A block which controls a list.
**Lessons:** [Lists](lists/README.md)

### List Element
A part of a list.

**Lessons:** [Lists](lists/README.md)

### Loop
A type of block that causes other code to run multiple times in succession. A control flow statement that allows code to be executed repeatedly based on a given Boolean condition.

**Lessons:** [Loops](loops/README.md)

## M

### Modeling
Building a system to simulate the behavior of a real-life phenomenon by simplifying or ignoring certain details.

**Lessons:** [Loops](loops/README.md)

## N

### Nested Loop
A loop used inside the body of another loop.

**Lessons:** [Loops](loops/README.md)

## O

### Operator Block
A block that performs math functions and string handling.

**Lessons:** [Lists](lists/README.md)

## P

### Predicate Block
A hexagonal block that always returns a Boolean value (true or false).

### Procedural Decomposition
Breaking a problem down into smaller subtasks, usually to increase readability and/or maintainability, often by applying one of the above concepts.

**Lessons:** [Customization](customization/README.md)

### Programming List
Called an 'array' in most programming languages, this holds lots of values.

**Lessons:** [Lists](lists/README.md)

## Q

`No Q entries`

## R

### Receive Block
Code Block in Control that receives a message from another block.

**Lessons:** [Getting Started with Snap!](getting_started_with_snap/README.md)

### Reporter Block
Report a value, usually for use in another block's input slot.

**Lessons:** [Customization](customization/README.md)

## S

### Say Block
The block gives its sprite a speech bubble with the specified text — the speech bubble stays until an another speech or thought block is activated, or the stop sign is pressed.

**Lessons:** [Customization](customization/README.md)

### Scenario
A description of a set of interactions and/or tasks that describe a start-to-finish example of how a user might want to use the application

**Lessons:** [Final Project](final_projects/README.md)

### Snap!
Snap! is an extended reimplementation of [Scratch](http://scratch.mit.edu) that allows you to Build Your Own Blocks.  It also features ﬁrst class lists, ﬁrst class procedures, first class sprites, first class costumes, first class sounds, and first class continuations.  These added capabilities make it suitable for a serious introduction to computer science for high school or college students.

**References:** [Blocks](references/blocks/README.md) |**Lessons:** [Getting Started with Snap!](getting_started_with_snap/README.md)

### Sequential Search Algorithm
A method for finding a target value within a list. It sequentially checks each element of the list for the target value until a match is found or until all the elements have been searched.
