### Costume
A costume is one out of possibly many "frames" or alternate appearances of a sprite. A new appearance imported and applied to a sprite. There are 3 ways to import a sprite after its been selected in the sprite corral: One way is to click on the file icon in the tool bar, then choose the “Costumes…”menu item.  You will see a list of costumes from the public media library, and can choose one.  The second way, for a costume stored on your own computer, is to click on the file icon and choose the “Import…” menu item.  You can then select a file in any picture format (PNG, JPEG, etc.) supported by your browser.  The third way is quicker if the file you want is visible on the desktop:  Just drag the file onto the Snap! window.

### Command block
Most command blocks have a brick shape. Each command block corresponds to an action that Snap! already knows how to carry out.

### Reporter Block
A report block runs, instead of carrying out an action, it reports a value that can be used as an input to another block.  If you drag a reporter into the scripting area by itself and click on it, the value it reports will appear in a speech balloon next to the block. When you drag a reporter block over another block’s input slot, a white “halo” appears around that input slot, analogous to the white line that appears when snapping command blocks together.

### Snap
Snap! is an extended reimplementation of [Scratch](http://scratch.mit.edu) that allows you to Build Your Own Blocks.  It also features ﬁrst class lists, ﬁrst class procedures, first class sprites, first class costumes, first class sounds, and first class continuations.  These added capabilities make it suitable for a serious introduction to computer science for high school or college students.

### Scripts
A script is assembled by dragging blocks from a palette into the scripting area in the middle part of the window. A script isn’t required to have a [hat block](glossaryv2.md#hat-block), but if not, then the script will be run only if the user clicks on the script itself.  A script can’t have more than one hat block, and the hat block can be used only at the top of the script.
**Related**: [hat block](glossaryv2.md#hat-block)

### Sprites
The arrowhead shape on the stage at the right end of the window. A sprite doesn’t have to look like an arrowhead, but can have any picture as a costume. Each sprite has its own scripts. 

### Stage
The background of a project, performs functions through scripting.
