# Actions in Snap!

## Assembling a script
A script is assembled by dragging blocks from a palette into the scripting area in the middle part of the window.

## Snapping
Blocks snap together (hence the name Snap!  for the language) when you drag a block so that its indentation is near the tab of the one above it.

## Signals
### Horizontal Lines
The white horizontal line is a signal that if you let go of the green block it will snap into the tab of the gold one.

### Halo
If you see a halo and let go, the block will wrap around the haloed blocks. The halo will always extend from the cursor position to the bottom of the script.
