### Creating a Snap! account 

Before you start your first lab assignment, be sure to create a Snap account. To set up a new account, find the cloud-shaped button in the top toolbar in the upper left corner of the Snap window: 

 
 

Click the cloud-shaped button, select the "sign up" option in the menu, and follow the instructions there. You will need to check your email after creating your account to verify your account. (Tip: Check your junk or spam folder if you don't see the email in your inbox).

Type a project name in the empty space at top of the window. Then, click the "Save" button at the bottom of the window.  

 

If you are completing an assignment for a class, it is a good idea to name your project after the assignment. Include the assignment number if it has one. For example, if you are working on an assignment called "Lab 1.1: Welcome to SNAP!" It is a good idea to name your project "Lab 1.1: Welcome to Snap!" This will help you keep track of all your work.
