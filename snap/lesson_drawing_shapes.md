## Lab 

 

### Block categories 

As you saw in Lab 1.1, all of the [blocks](onenote:Glossary.one#Glossary&section-id={ba801250-2f51-4298-b46b-61766397c088}&page-id={2e1d37b1-066f-4d94-a96a-1f204a6a23d6}&end) in Snap are organized into categories.  Each category is a different color. You can access each category by clicking on the tabs at the top left of the [Snap Window](onenote:#Snap%20Window&section-id={bd944216-ae14-4da7-9e9c-e8ddfd7e5463}&page-id={e510ce73-fecb-46b8-96ba-617f262f66a8}&end).  

 


 

The blocks are categorized under each tab based on what each block does. The [References](onenote:References.one#Markdown&section-id={e721da9c-417a-4281-b632-29bbb442ae01}&page-id={ec5eb0f4-4e6f-d14d-9e7a-2a651877eeab}&end) section includes a description of each category. It also includes an explanation of the functionality of each block within a category.   

  

### Drawing Shapes 

Before you start drawing shapes in Snap!, it is important to understand the difference between a polygon's interior angles and exterior angles.  

 

A polygon's *interior angles* are the angles formed inside a polygon by two adjacent sides.  

 

A polygon's *exterior angles* are the angles between the side of a polygon and an adjacent side extended outward.  

 

The diagram below show the interior angles and exterior angles of an *equilateral triangle*, which is a triangle with three sides that are the same length:

The *exterior angles* of an equilateral triangle are each 120 degrees. See the code below for an example of how to use this information  to draw an equilateral triangle.

Exterior angles formula 

Regular polygons are angles that have equal angles and equal sides. The sum of the exterior angles of a polygon is 360.  Therefore, you can use this formula to determine the size of each exterior angle in a regular polygon:

n = number of sides
