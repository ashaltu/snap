# Building Blocks 

## Lesson 

 

### Grace Hopper 

Grace Hopper is a pioneer in computer science. During World War Two, she joined the Navy and helped to create the Mark I and Mark II computers which could perform calculations and create mathematical tables. She also originated the term "Debugging." 

 


 

### Debugging 

While working on the Mark II Computer, Grace Hopper found a moth in the system that stopped it from working. The moth was removed from the computer and taped to her logbook. 

 


 

Since then, whenever something in your code is not working, it is called a bug, and debugging refers to the process where someone tries to fix the problem.
