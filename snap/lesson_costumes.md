# Costumes

## **Short definition**:
What the sprite looks like (triangle, dog, cat).

## Using Multiple Costumes

### What are the benefits of having multiple costumes?

Multiple costumes allow for the animation of objects and allow for the visualization of actions. For instance, if you have a dragon and want it to breath fire when another sprite gets too close, you can have a costume for a walking dragon and another for a dragon breathing fire. Similarly, if you have a frog that transforms into a prince, you can have multiple costumes for that transformation.

### How do I switch between costumes?

There are two ways:

1.  You can manually switch between costumes by clicking on them in the "Costumes" tab next to Scripts.
2.  You can automatically switch between costumes by using the block "switch to costume" or "next costume" in the looks category.
