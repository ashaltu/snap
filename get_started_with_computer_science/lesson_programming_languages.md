# Programming Languages 

## Lesson 

 

### Computer programs 

A "computer program" is a sequence of instructions or steps, written in a language that can be understood by a computer, that will be used by the computer to complete a task or solve a problem. 



### The Snap! programming language 

In this class, you will use a program called Snap! to complete your assignments. Snap! is a visual, drag-and-drop programming language. It is similar to other visual coding languages like [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) and [MakeCode](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/makecode) but has some unique features like first class data types. You can read more about first class data types [here](https://snap.berkeley.edu/about#firstclass). 

 

### Opening Snap! in a browser 

SNAP is different than many other programming languages â€” you run it in a web browser like Firefox or Chrome instead of running it locally on your computer. You can use this URL to visit the Snap home page:

You can use also this URL to skip the home page and start programming in Snap right away:
