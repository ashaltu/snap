#Motion
The Motion palette provides blocks

## Move
Palette: Motion
Block Type: [Command](glossary)

The Move block tells the sprite (the arrowhead shape on the stage at the right end of the window) to move ten steps (a step is a very small unit of distance) in the direction in which the arrowhead is pointing. 

### Inputs
The default number 10 in the move block above is called an input to the block.
