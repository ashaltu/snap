# Snap Block Categories

## Categories

All of the [blocks](../../glossary.md#block) in Snap are organized into palettes. Each category is a different color. You can access each palette by clicking on the tabs at the top left of the [Snap Window](../how-to/snap-window.md).

### E-shaped blocks
For “E-shaped” blocks with more than one C-shaped slot, only the first slot will wrap around existing blocks in a script, and only if that C-shaped slot is empty before wrapping. (You can fill the other slots by dragging blocks into the desired slot.)
